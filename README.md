# learn.it
Hackathon project for CodeNection 2025. 

## Track Selected:
Track 1 : Student Lifestyle - Tutoring for Students

## Problem Statement:
Many students struggle with academic challenges, including difficulty understanding course material, limited access to personalized help, and inefficient study habits. Traditional tutoring services are often expensive, inconvenient, or unavailable outside of fixed hours, leaving students without adequate support when they need it most. This gap hinders academic performance, increases stress, and discourages independent learning.

Develop a tutoring platform that provides on-demand, affordable, and personalized academic assistance. The platform will connect students with qualified tutors (which may be other students), offer interactive learning tools, and provide access to curated study resources. By making tutoring more accessible and effective, this solution should enhance learning outcomes, boost student confidence, and promote academic success for students of all levels.


## About learn.it

**learn.it** is a focused web application designed to help students learn more effectively and connect with the help they need. Our platform addresses the common struggles of a lack of focus and difficulty finding personalized guidance. We empower students by providing tools for efficient self-study, a space for real-time collaboration, and expert mentorshipâ€”both human and AI-powered.

## Proposed Features

1. **Resources Hub:** A centralized space for users to upload and share learning materials, tutorials, and study guides with the community.
2. **Online Study Rooms:** A distraction-free environment to help you focus. Study rooms include:
3. **Pomodoro Timer:** A built-in timer to manage focused study sessions and breaks.
4. **Mentor Integration:** Students can invite human mentors or an AI mentor directly into the room for real-time assistance.
5. **Online Mentor Sessions:** Mentors can create and host dedicated online meetings for one-on-one or group sessions, providing a professional space for personalized teaching.
6. **AI Mentor Matching:** Our AI algorithm analyzes a student's profile and learning needs to suggest the most suitable mentor for them, ensuring they get the best help possible.
7. **Gamification:** Stay motivated by competing with friends on a leaderboard and collecting "credits" by completing daily missions like studying for a certain amount of time or helping others.

# learn.it
Hackathon project for CodeNection 2025. 

## Problem Statement:
Many students struggle with academic challenges, including difficulty understanding course material, limited access to personalized help, and inefficient study habits. Traditional tutoring services are often expensive, inconvenient, or unavailable outside of fixed hours, leaving students without adequate support when they need it most. This gap hinders academic performance, increases stress, and discourages independent learning.

Develop a tutoring platform that provides on-demand, affordable, and personalized academic assistance. The platform will connect students with qualified tutors (which may be other students), offer interactive learning tools, and provide access to curated study resources. By making tutoring more accessible and effective, this solution should enhance learning outcomes, boost student confidence, and promote academic success for students of all levels.
